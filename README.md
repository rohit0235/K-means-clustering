# K-Means Clustering Project

This repository contains the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into **K clusters**, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

## Introduction
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment a dataset into distinct clusters. It is often used for tasks such as customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.


## Algorithm
The K-Means algorithm works as follows:
1. **Initialization**: Select `K` initial centroids, either randomly or using a specific initialization technique.
2. **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. **Update Step**: Recalculate the centroid of each cluster based on the assigned data points.
4. **Repeat** until convergence (i.e., when centroids no longer move or a maximum number of iterations is reached).

The project uses [name of the library, e.g., Scikit-learn] to implement K-Means clustering.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k-means-clustering.git
cd k-means-clustering
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installation, you can run the clustering algorithm with the following command:
```bash
python kmeans_clustering.py --dataset path/to/dataset.csv --clusters K
```

Example:
```bash
python kmeans_clustering.py --dataset data/iris.csv --clusters 3
```
